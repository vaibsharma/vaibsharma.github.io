# AI/ML in Production: Lessons Learned

Deploying machine learning models to production is where the real challenge begins. Here are the hard-earned lessons from my experience building ML systems at scale.

## The Reality of ML in Production

Building ML models is only 20% of the work. The remaining 80% is about:
- Data pipeline reliability
- Model monitoring and drift detection
- A/B testing and experimentation
- Performance optimization
- Error handling and fallbacks

## Lesson 1: Data Quality is Everything

Your model is only as good as your data. In production, data quality issues can silently degrade model performance.

## Lesson 2: Model Monitoring is Critical

Models degrade over time. You need comprehensive monitoring to detect when this happens.

## Lesson 3: A/B Testing is Essential

You can't improve what you don't measure. A/B testing helps you understand the real impact of your models.

## Conclusion

ML in production is challenging but rewarding. The key is to start simple, monitor everything, and learn from your mistakes.
